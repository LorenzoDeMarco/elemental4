## Reporting a Vulnerability
To report vulnerabilities, email "services at ledomsoft dot com".
We'll address the issue as soon as possible. We may contact you via GitHub email
or Discord chat.
Accepted vulnerabilities cause a minor build to be published. Occasionally, we may
address more than one in a single minor build.
